General bash notes:

    Great reference website: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html
    When assigning variables, don’t leave spaces on any side of the equals sign

Sync directories between local and remote computers (copies the contents from the first directory to the second directory (it does not delete files in the second directory if they weren’t present in the first directory which is very nice)). Note that it is important to have the forward slash at the end of the first directory (so that you only transfer the contents of that directory as opposed to planting the source directory in the destination directory). No slash after the destination directory. -a flag stands for archive and will preserve modification times, sym links (I think?), and permissions. -z flags stands for compression. –progress will show the files being transferred and the progress of those transfers

rsync -e “ssh -p <port-number>” -az –progress <remote-user>@<ip-address>:<remote-path>/ <local-path>

Find library or package locations

sudo dpkg -L

Find text in file names (different from grep which looks for text in files)

find . -type f -name “*text*”

Find text in a directory:

grep –include=\*.{c,h} -rnw ‘directory’ -e “pattern”

List all processes (flag -e) in standard file format (-f):

ps -ef

Lookup specific processes:

pgrep firefox

Kill a specific process:

pkill firefox

Remove a package using dpkg

sudo -E dpkg -r <package>

Recursively delete files of specific extension

find . -name “*.ext” -type f -delete

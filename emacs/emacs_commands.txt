Some neat regular expressions:

Replace-regexp:

2 -> \,(+ 3 \#)

What's going on: \, says we're going to do a Lisp expression. We're going to add 3 and \#. Note that this notation doesn't work!: (3 + \#). No good! \# stands for the number of replacements that have already occurred.

New-line: C-q C-j

I see what's happening now with my ngspice script. As long as I am modelling the
plasma as a variable resistor that can freely vary between what I consider it's "open
circuit" condition (below breakdown voltage) and "short circuit" condition (above 
breakdown voltage), then the "plasma" will adopt whatever resistance is necessary
such that the potential across the plasma is exactly equal to the breakdown voltage.

So, if I want to do a circuit model of the plasma, I cannot allow it to be a continuously
varying resistance between open and short circuit conditions.
